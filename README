This plugin enables you to inject assets to a layout.

  layout.assets << "application.js"
  layout.assets << "styles.css"

  ie_stylesheet = Stylesheet.new("ie.css")
  ie_stylesheet.condition = "<= IE 6"
  layout.assets << ie_stylesheet

That's pretty much it. Those three assets will be injected to your output regardless of the layout you are using.

Oh, you can specify default assets in your environment:

  Layout::Base.default_assets = %w{application.js styles.css}
